# AI Story and Illustration Generator

An AI-powered system that leverages modular agents to automatically generate children's storybooks, combining engaging storytelling with dynamic illustrations.  
Built using [Dify](https://dify.ai/) for agent orchestration.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This system is composed of multiple AI agents working together:
- **Feature Extractor**: Extracts key themes and story elements from user input.
- **Story Generator**: Generates creative story content based on extracted features.
- **Illustration Generator**: Creates illustrations matching the story scenes.
- **Storybook Content Crawler** (optional): Enhances the storybook with additional content.
- **Workflow Orchestrator**: Connects all agents to create a fully automated pipeline.
